      <description>Version control is great, but sometimes it can trip you up!
In this post I recount my rather stupid mistake of using &lt;code&gt;git clean&lt;/code&gt; when I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have,
and how I got out of it.</description>

      <description>There is something to be said about the R-community. Actually, there is a lot to be said about the R-community, and I believe RStudio::conf is the empitamy of what this community actually is. While I&amp;rsquo;m in my hotel room as RStudio::conf Austin has just wrapped up, ending with an amazing Birds of a Feather session with RLadies, I&amp;rsquo;m having so many thoughts and feelings about this experience. I&amp;rsquo;m on a complete high, and cannot fathom that I just participated in something like this conference, which is quite something different than any other conference I have been to.</description>
