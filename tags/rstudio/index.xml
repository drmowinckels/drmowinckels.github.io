      <description>RStudio::conf Austin is the best conference experience I have had . It was thoroughly enjoyable and educational to see the different ways the same tools were applied to solve &amp;ldquo;real life-life problems&amp;rdquo; It was also enjoyable to see how they applied to problems in industry to solve real life problems . It is the empitamy of what this community actually is .</description>
