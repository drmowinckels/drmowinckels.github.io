      <description>This year has been truly something different for us all. Blogging has definitely taken a toll, as real life has been quite something to handle. So, in order to end the year with a bang, and something fun, I started a twitter advent calendar!
One day late in starting my #rstats ðŸ“¦ advent calendar, but better late than never!
In this thread, I will every day of December until the 24th post a package I find useful and want you all to know about!</description>

      <title>ggseg3d - creating interactive brain segmentation plots with plotly</title>

      <description>Looking through my blogposts, I realised I&amp;rsquo;ve never written about my colleague Didac and my package for 3d mesh plots of brain atlases using plotly. I&amp;rsquo;ve already showed some functionality from out {ggseg}-package, in the introductory blogpost and follow-up on animating it.
I guess it&amp;rsquo;s extra timely to do it now, as we recently split the mesh-plot function off the main {ggseg}-package and into it&amp;rsquo;s own package, and also did some re-writing of core-functionality of the package.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m super delighted that our ggseg package was so well received! We almost immediately got it on Neuroconductor, which is a neuroimaging equivalent to Bioconductor. We got some pull requests from people helping us improve the code, and particularly get it ready for CRAN when we decide to submit it there.
In all of this, I learned so much about creating packages, and ended up making quite a major alteration to the base-functions of the package.</description>

      <title>Introducing the ggseg R-package for brain segmentations</title>

      <description>Edit: Though posted only a week ago, we have discovered another R package called ggBrain which has slightly different functions than what our package has. Because of this, we have altered the name of our package to ggseg short for ggsegmentation which is a better description of what our package does.
I&amp;rsquo;ve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work.</description>
