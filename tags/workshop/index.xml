      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: How to work efficiently with datasets in R using the Tidyverse, a Carpentries-style workshop.
The workshop is intended to be interactive, was initially developed to be run as a webinar, and can be expanded to single or two whole day workshop.
The workshop is intended both for R beginners as well as intermediate R users who know base-R well but wish to learn more about the Tidyverse way of working with data.
At the end of the workshop you will have a grasp of the Tidyverse way of working with data, and have learned new ways of efficiently working with data in R.</description>
