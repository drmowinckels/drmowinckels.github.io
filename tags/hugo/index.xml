      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work in getting Hugo websites building through Github actions, and then have them deployed with Netlify. Of course, once we are building with GitHub actions we could also just use GitHub pages to deploy, and I&amp;rsquo;ll show how you can do that too, even if I will keep using Netlify.
Why build with GitHub actions and not let Netlify do all the job? Well, there is definitely good reasons to let Netlify do all the work for you.</description>

      <description>For more than a year now I have avoided updating my hugo-version on netlify and updating my theme because there was a lot of work that needed to be done to make that happen. I did not really have enough time or motivation to actually get it sorted, as it involved understanding theme changes and hugo changes.
But last week I finally got working on it, and decided I would not stop until I had it done.</description>
