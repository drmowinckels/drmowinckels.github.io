      <description>It is advent! And we all know by now how much I LOVE advent and Christmas. Keeping true to who I am and that I finally have some extra energy for things like this, this advent brings you a series of 24 pieces of code I often use in my work, and that I hope can be of interest and help to you.
1st of December - Creating a directory I often find myself doing quite some file handling in my work, often leading to many of the same things happening over and over in slightly different contexts.</description>
