      <description>GitHub is a major developer platform, and your profile is the first thing people see when they visit your account.
Your GitHub profile should then showcase who you are, what you know and what you&amp;rsquo;re learning.
This is how I vamped up my GitHub profile, to showcase who I am, what I know and what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.</description>

      <description>Using GitHub Actions is a service that runs Continuous Integration, meaning that using a set-up file you can ask workers (computers run by GitHub) to do certain operations on your repository at certain triggers (at push, pull-requests or even on a schedule with crontab) This is where GitHub Actions shines. It is free and so are its actions for small jobs like what we want to do . To build on Netlify, you need all your content version controlled, in my case with git, and stored on GitHub . This is fine and dandy for text files like markdown, csv data, and images that &lt;em&gt;will not change often&lt;/em&gt;.</description>
