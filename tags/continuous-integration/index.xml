      <description>Using GitHub Actions is a service that runs Continuous Integration, meaning that using a set-up file you can ask workers (computers run by GitHub) to do certain operations on your repository at certain triggers (at push, pull-requests or even on a schedule with crontab) This is where GitHub Actions shines. It is free and so are its actions for small jobs like what we want to do . To build on Netlify, you need all your content version controlled, in my case with git, and stored on GitHub . This is fine and dandy for text files like markdown, csv data, and images that &lt;em&gt;will not change often&lt;/em&gt;.</description>
