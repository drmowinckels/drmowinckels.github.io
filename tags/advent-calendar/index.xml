      <description>It is advent! And we all know by now how much I LOVE advent and Christmas. Keeping true to who I am and that I finally have some extra energy for things like this, this advent brings you a series of 24 pieces of code I often use in my work, and that I hope can be of interest and help to you.
1st of December - Creating a directory I often find myself doing quite some file handling in my work, often leading to many of the same things happening over and over in slightly different contexts.</description>

      <description>This year has been truly something different for us all. Blogging has definitely taken a toll, as real life has been quite something to handle. So, in order to end the year with a bang, and something fun, I started a twitter advent calendar!
One day late in starting my #rstats ðŸ“¦ advent calendar, but better late than never!
In this thread, I will every day of December until the 24th post a package I find useful and want you all to know about!</description>
