      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long time since I wrote anything. Life has been unexpectedly overwhelming for a period, still is I guess, but one musters on. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in old town Fredrikstad while my cat is getting some tests at the vets&amp;rsquo;, so I finally get some time and want to write something here. And we will continue with some R for Psychologists.
I my first R for Psychologists post we really dove into it.</description>

      <description>I recently was talking with a good friend and brilliant researcher regarding the advantages of R. As you can guess, I was the advocate. Coming from psychology, we are mainly taught to use &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; analysis tools, and mainly SPSS. I never liked SPSS, even as a student. not knowing of any possible alternatives or what could be improved, I just thought the whole thing felt too black-boxy. But it is a convenient tool, when the data is already in a relatively clean format, and the analyses you want to do are straight forward, and you don&amp;rsquo;t mind not knowing exactly the formula SPSS uses to calculate your results.</description>
