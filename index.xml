      <title>**Talks**: The ggseg-suite of R-packages</title>

      <description>This is a lit of talks I have had for the ggseg-suite of package developed by myself and my co-worker Didac Vidal-Piñeiro.
The packages create the possibility of visualizing brain atlas data directly in 2d fully inflated brains or brain slices through ggplot2, and as 3d mesh plots through plotly. They are intended to create easier workflows for researchers working in R and neuroimaging, reducing the need to switch between software too often.</description>

      <description>This package is developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pineiro, whose had the whole idea.
This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases. Click the eye below to see a demonstration of the package.
It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.

      <guid>https://drmowinckels.io/workshops/workshops-lmm/</guid>
      <description>This is a 2 hour workshop in doing Linear Mixed Models in R. The workshop is intended to be interactive, and can be expanded to a whole day.
This workshop is an introductory workshop in Linear Mixed Models in R.
It will cover some basic information on how to identify if a data-set is ill-suited for standard linear models, and mixed models are better.
After this it covers how to specify linear mixed models, inspect the model output, and create tables and figures based on the model results.</description>

      <description>This is a 4 hour workshop on working with the tidyverse packages in R. The workshop is intended to be interactive, was initially developed to be run as a webinar, and can be expanded to single or two whole day workshop.
R has become a popular tool for doing statistical analysis. However, the sheer number of different packages for data preparation and analysis makes R code heterogeneous, hard to read, and error-prone.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I have loved going to Posit::conf (then RStudio::conf) before. There is a general air of excitement, nerdiness and support I just rarely feel at any other conf I go to. It&amp;rsquo;s like it gathers all the best Data science and R geeks in one place and we just go bananas in each others company.
Going to Chicago this year for the first ever Posit::conf was no exception to that.</description>

      <description>It is advent! And we all know by now how much I LOVE advent and Christmas. Keeping true to who I am and that I finally have some extra energy for things like this, this advent brings you a series of 24 pieces of code I often use in my work, and that I hope can be of interest and help to you.

      <description>When programming we want to write code that iterates well. In many languages, we do this through loops. I was introduced to loops both in MatLab and in the Bourne Again Shell (bash).
So naturaly, when I started working in R, I was looping all over the place. Especially before I learned tidyverse, I was looping over columns and rows in data.frames to manipulate data into how I needed things to be.</description>

This has been really fun, but also a little tedious. The survey has two basic type of questions, likert-scale questions and binary yes/no questions. For each of these two types of questions, I’ve needed to generate a set of descriptive plots and tables, as well as run a particular set of statistical models.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a short one. I have been wanting to change my comment section from disqus to utterances for a long while, but have been postponing. Or procrastinating… with me, its usually the latter. I’m not going to go into details of why I wanted to move away from disqus, others have written better about it that I ever could.
I was procrastinating mainly because it felt like a little much to figure out utterances too, and the idea of using GitHub issues for comments felt awkward.</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to Build your Hugo Website</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work in getting Hugo websites building through Github actions, and then have them deployed with Netlify. Of course, once we are building with GitHub actions we could also just use GitHub pages to deploy, and I&amp;rsquo;ll show how you can do that too, even if I will keep using Netlify.
Why build with GitHub actions and not let Netlify do all the job? Well, there is definitely good reasons to let Netlify do all the work for you.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, we released a new version of our ggseg R-package for visualisations of brain atlases. I had been wanting to create such an update for a long time, but getting the internal logics of a ggplot geom working as I wanted was rather difficult. Likely because I was trying to do too many things, but, hey&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s me!
One of the main things I wanted to get rid of, was this need to first group your data before sending it to ggplot if you want to facet.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new year, and I think we are all ready for it! At least I am.
This is just a short post, with a ggplot2 holiday card wishing you all a better 2021 than 2020! Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, there not much needed for that to happen, and with vaccines being distributed I have hopes.
I hope the New Year, at some point, makes it possible to start going to conferences again and that I can get to meet ore R-aficionados when the time allows.</description>

One day late in starting my #rstats 📦 advent calendar, but better late than never!
In this thread, I will every day of December until the 24th post a package I find useful and want you all to know about!</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk linear regression. It&amp;rsquo;s the thing we learn about first year in psychology at Uni, and it blows all our minds that we are doing math in psychology. An unfortunate effect of all high school student counsellors in Norway thinking all psychologists do is shrink people&amp;rsquo;s heads. And then here we come to Uni and first semester they stick us with math.
I&amp;rsquo;m no statistician, I&amp;rsquo;m no mathematician. So I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest with you all, I am not the one to answer your most indepth and deep questions about stats.</description>

      <description>When you work with neuroimaging data like I do, you often find your self swapping back and forth between R and the imaging software of your choise. For me, that is usually FSL or Freesurfer. Since the resolution of the brain we have is quite large and 3 dimensional, we often reduce the data to segments that meaningfully go together. For instance, areas of the brain that control language or visual processing, or areas of the brain with similar structural properties.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another Christmas special. Last year I made a Christmas tree ggplot, and animated some snow and sparkling baubles. That was a lot of fun, and I decided I wanted to do something similar this year too. But this year we&amp;rsquo;re going to build a snowman.
Body A snowman needs a body, so lets start with that! Let&amp;rsquo;s go for a two large body ball&amp;rsquo;s, and a head. First attempt is to specify the center of the circles we&amp;rsquo;re going to draw&amp;rsquo;s locations, and their radii.</description>

      <description>Looking through my blogposts, I realised I&amp;rsquo;ve never written about my colleague Didac and my package for 3d mesh plots of brain atlases using plotly. I&amp;rsquo;ve already showed some functionality from out {ggseg}-package, in the introductory blogpost and follow-up on animating it.
I guess it&amp;rsquo;s extra timely to do it now, as we recently split the mesh-plot function off the main {ggseg}-package and into it&amp;rsquo;s own package, and also did some re-writing of core-functionality of the package.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m full of making packages and unit testing these days, and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel particularly confident in my unit testing skills to be sharing those yet. But, thankfully, I am also back in the GAMM corner lately. There is something very satisfying to me about running appropriate models and seeing the results. But, plotting the results of GAMMs are not always so easy, especially if you have some interactions in there.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in old town Fredrikstad while my cat is getting some tests at the vets&#39;, so I finally get some time and want to write something here. And we will continue with some R for Psychologists.

There were several pre-conference workshops to attend, which I of course signed up for. After debating heavily with my self of what to choose, the cruelty was really that all the workshops looked amazing, I decided to go for &amp;ldquo;Building tidy tools&amp;rdquo; with Charlotte Wickham and Hadley Wickham.</description>

      <description>There is something to be said about the R-community. Actually, there is a lot to be said about the R-community, and I believe RStudio::conf is the empitamy of what this community actually is. While I&amp;rsquo;m in my hotel room as RStudio::conf Austin has just wrapped up, ending with an amazing Birds of a Feather session with RLadies, I&amp;rsquo;m having so many thoughts and feelings about this experience. I&amp;rsquo;m on a complete high, and cannot fathom that I just participated in something like this conference, which is quite something different than any other conference I have been to.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas! And I love Christmas! Pretty snow, cozy fires, fairy lights, family, friends and love. It&amp;rsquo;s just filled with all times of lovely things.
That also means&amp;hellip; PLOTS! You might know from my previous posts that I love plotting. A bit too much, but it truly is a lovely thing to create a great plot.
So, a while ago, the amazing RLadies network showed me this cool thing a stats professor does each Christmas at the end of his visualisation lecture, I knew I had to do it!</description>

      <title>R for psychologists - just dive into it!</title>

      <description>I recently was talking with a good friend and brilliant researcher regarding the advantages of R. As you can guess, I was the advocate. Coming from psychology, we are mainly taught to use &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; analysis tools, and mainly SPSS. I never liked SPSS, even as a student. not knowing of any possible alternatives or what could be improved, I just thought the whole thing felt too black-boxy. But it is a convenient tool, when the data is already in a relatively clean format, and the analyses you want to do are straight forward, and you don&amp;rsquo;t mind not knowing exactly the formula SPSS uses to calculate your results.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m super delighted that our ggseg package was so well received! We almost immediately got it on Neuroconductor, which is a neuroimaging equivalent to Bioconductor. We got some pull requests from people helping us improve the code, and particularly get it ready for CRAN when we decide to submit it there.
In all of this, I learned so much about creating packages, and ended up making quite a major alteration to the base-functions of the package.</description>

      <description>Edit: Though posted only a week ago, we have discovered another R package called ggBrain which has slightly different functions than what our package has. Because of this, we have altered the name of our package to ggseg short for ggsegmentation which is a better description of what our package does.
I&amp;rsquo;ve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work.</description>

      <title>Circular plots in R and adding images</title>

      <description>Last post was definately my most succesful (and I have so much experience :P). But it was fun with all the feedback and appreciation. So I&amp;rsquo;ll continue with a little more plotting. Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena. I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it, with BRAINS!</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago we had out first RLadies-Oslo meetup! It was such a great turnout, and I had so much fun presenting to the group of lovely folks!
And indeed it is true, I love plotting. Probably more than I love analysing data (and definately more than cleaning and wrangling :P). I can spend hours and hours creating my own custom plotting functions for whatever paper/output I am currently working on.</description>

      <title>GAMM random effects</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working a lot with Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) lately, and so, it seems I will be doing a small series on them as we go now. After a little feedback, I did some small alterations to the last post, hopefully it is a little easier to follow, you can read it here.
For this part I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about random effects in mgcv::gamm as they are a little different from what I am used to from, for instance lme4 or even a standard GAM.</description>

      <description>Here we go! Stepping into the world of blogging through R and blogdown! This is both super exciting and slightly scary, I have not really shared code online like I plan here before. But I guess we start somewhere. And we start with plotting.
A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package mgcv. The analyses work very well, and results were as expected. There were also some built in plotting functions for the gamm output in R.</description>
