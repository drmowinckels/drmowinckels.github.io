      <description>&lt;strong&gt;R-Packages&lt;/strong&gt;: A set of packages for visualizing brain atlas data in R.
The packages create the possibility of visualizing brain atlas data directly in 2d fully inflated brains or brain slices through ggplot2, and as 3d mesh plots through plotly.
They are intended to create easier workflows for researchers working in R and neuroimaging, reducing the need to switch between software too often.</description>

      <description>This package is developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pineiro, whose had the whole idea.
This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases. Click the eye below to see a demonstration of the package.
It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.</description>

      <description>This package uses the nettskjema API developed by the University of Oslo IT, making it possible to communicate with the University of Oslo specialized survey platform &amp;rsquo;nettskjema&amp;rsquo;. Currently the package is geared towards downloading and creating data.frames in R from answers to surveys. This is an easy and convenient way for people to access data they have stored in the survey platform into R and ready for analyses.

      <description>In August, Heidi Seibold wrote in her Newsletter about how she made it FAIR.
This made me think about my own writing and how to secure the content even when/if I port by blog or change its structure.
Here, I show how I use R, GitHub Actions and Zenodo API to create dois for all my posts.</description>

      <description>GitHub is a major developer platform, and your profile is the first thing people see when they visit your account.
Your GitHub profile should then showcase who you are, what you know and what you&amp;rsquo;re learning.
This is how I vamped up my GitHub profile, to showcase who I am, what I know and what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.</description>

      <description>We all know the R startup message. It tells us the version
of R we are running, the date, the platform we are running
on, and some informative tips on using R.
When you&amp;rsquo;ve been using R a while, though, it gets old.
Let me show you how you can customise your startup message!</description>

      <description>People who code have a tendency to spend a lot of time in various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). They can be as simple as a text editor or as complex as a full-blown development environment. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through my two go-to IDE&amp;rsquo;s, RStudio and VScode, and why I switch between them rather than sticking to a single one.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Apply&amp;rsquo;ing is based on the very well-known &lt;code&gt;mtcars&lt;/code&gt; dataset built-in to R .

      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: How to work efficiently with datasets in R using the Tidyverse, a Carpentries-style workshop.
The workshop is intended to be interactive, was initially developed to be run as a webinar, and can be expanded to single or two whole day workshop.
The workshop is intended both for R beginners as well as intermediate R users who know base-R well but wish to learn more about the Tidyverse way of working with data.
At the end of the workshop you will have a grasp of the Tidyverse way of working with data, and have learned new ways of efficiently working with data in R.</description>

For each of these two types of . questions, I‚Äôve needed to generate a . set of descriptive plots and tables, as well as run a particular set of statistical models . I know how to make Rmark down parametrised reports, and I kind of wanted something similar, but in a nested fashion .</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to Build your Hugo Website</title>

      <guid>https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021/using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/</guid>
      <description>Using GitHub Actions is a service that runs Continuous Integration, meaning that using a set-up file you can ask workers (computers run by GitHub) to do certain operations on your repository at certain triggers (at push, pull-requests or even on a schedule with crontab) This is where GitHub Actions shines. It is free and so are its actions for small jobs like what we want to do . To build on Netlify, you need all your content version controlled, in my case with git, and stored on GitHub . This is fine and dandy for text files like markdown, csv data, and images that &lt;em&gt;will not change often&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <description>Blogdown is usually used with [go hugo], a static webpage builder . Blogdown renders directly from &lt;code&gt;Rmd&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;html, meaning it circumvents hugo&#39;s processing of &lt;/code&gt;md` . This can cause some unwanted issues depending on your theme . It can also make it difficult to maintain your webpage over time .</description>

      <description>Do you wanna build a snowman? Do you want to build a Christmas tree? We&amp;rsquo;re going to use [ggforce] from the [gg force] package by Thomas Lin Pedersen . We need to specify the center of the circles we&amp;rsquo;re drawing&amp;rsquo;s locations and their radii . We use &amp;lsquo;geom_circle&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;tidyr&amp;rsquo; to create the snowman .</description>

      <description>Plotting GAMM interactions with ggplot2 is not always easy, especially if you have some interactions in there . Plotting the results of GAMMs are not always so easy . I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the &lt;code&gt;diamonds&lt;/code&gt; dataset for this, as it has some nice non-linear features .</description>

      <description>RStudio::conf Austin is the best conference experience I have had . It was thoroughly enjoyable and educational to see the different ways the same tools were applied to solve &amp;ldquo;real life-life problems&amp;rdquo; It was also enjoyable to see how they applied to problems in industry to solve real life problems . It is the empitamy of what this community actually is .</description>

      <description>R requires you to be proficient in R in a different way than SPSS . Once you are proficient enough in R, you have a gazillion tools to do more or less anything you want to do, be it analysing complex data, a simple linear regression, writing a blog or making interactive data portals . RStudio is a completely blank slate, no data, no fancy stuff, just a program .</description>

      <description>The ggseg package was so well received that we almost immediately got it on [Neuroconductor]. We got some pull requests from people helping us improve the code, and particularly get it ready for CRAN when we decide to submit it there . The package vignettes are update on how you may supply data for facetting .</description>

      <description>Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena . I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it .</description>

      <description>Adding external images to plots is a good way to showcase results, and make it easier for me and my reader to understand what the findings are . I use [ImageMagick] for this, but there are R-packages to help, like [imager] and [imaging] software .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working a lot with Generalized Additive Mixed Mixed Models (GAMMs) I started seeing some differences in the output from other mixed models I had run through [lme4] and even Bayesian mixed models with [rstanarm] The random effects terms were specified differently . At first I thought this was mainly the fact that I was now using smoothing splines, which I was unfamiliar with running before .</description>

      <description>A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package [mgcv] The analyses work very well, and results were as expected . There were also some built in plotting functions for the gamm output in R . However, they were with base-r, and we all know base r is not the most beautiful .</description>
