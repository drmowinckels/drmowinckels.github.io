    This is a theme for creating a website theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. The Hugo Igloo
    theme is the theme of my website and created using UIkit 3.

As a good friend said once: 

> Webdev is not your work, don't lie. It's your hobby.

ok, so I paraphrased a little, but that's the essence of it. 
I love webdev, and I love creating websites.

So, this is my first attempt at creating a Hugo theme, all on my lonesome.
I hope others will like it as much as I do!
