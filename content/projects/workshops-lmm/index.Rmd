This is a 2 hour workshop in doing Linear Mixed Models in R. 
The workshop is intended to be interactive, and can be expanded to a whole day.


This workshop is an introductory workshop in Linear Mixed Models in R.

It will cover some basic information on how to identify if a data-set is ill-suited for standard linear models, and mixed models are better.

After this it covers how to specify linear mixed models, inspect the model output, and create tables and figures based on the model results.

The dragons data set used in this workshop is shamelessly stolen from Gabriela Hajduk’s introduction to LME’s. Her excellent tutorial is highly recommend, which I also have somewhat adapted my own workshop.
