  **R-Packages**: A set of packages for visualizing brain atlas data in R. 
  The packages create the possibility of visualizing brain atlas data directly in 2d fully inflated brains or brain slices through ggplot2, and as 3d mesh plots through plotly. 
  They are intended to create easier workflows for researchers working in R and neuroimaging, reducing the need to switch between software too often.
