This package uses the nettskjema API developed by the University of Oslo IT, making it possible to communicate with the University of Oslo specialized survey platform 'nettskjema'. 
Currently the package is geared towards downloading and creating data.frames in R from answers to surveys. 
This is an easy and convenient way for people to access data they have stored in the survey platform into R and ready for analyses. 

It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.
