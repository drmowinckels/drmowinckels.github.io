This dataset contains the raw fMRI data of a preregistered study.
Dataset includes:

session pre
1. anat/ anatomical scans (T1-weighted images) for each subject
2. func/ whole-brain EPI data from all task runs (8x single task, 2x dual task, 1x resting state and 2x localizer task)
3. fmap/ fieldmaps with magnitude1, magnitude2 and phasediff

session post
2. func/ whole-brain EPI data from all task runs (8x single task, 2x dual task)
3. fmap/ fieldmaps with magnitude1, magnitude2 and phasediff

Please note, some participants did not complete the post session. We updated our consent form to get explicit permission to publish the individual data, although not all participants resigned the new version. Those participants are excluded here but part of the t-maps on neurovault (compare participants.tsv).

Tasks were always included either visual or/and auditory input and required either manual or/and vocal responses (visual+manual and auditory+vocal are modality compatible and visual+vocal and auditory+manual are modality incompatible). Tasks were presented as either single task, or dual task. 
Participants completed a practice intervention prior to session post in which one group worked for 80 minutes outside the scanner on modality incompatible dual-tasks, one on modality compatible dual-task and the third one paused for 80 min.
