In [an older post](./blog/2022/lets-get-applying/), I showed the basics of replacing loops with apply functions.
I briefly touched on `mapply` at the end, but it deserves its own explanation because it's incredibly useful once you understand when to reach for it.

> The key difference: `sapply` works with one varying input, `mapply` works with multiple varying inputs that need to be paired up.

## When `sapply` isn't enough

Let's start with a scenario where `sapply` works fine, then see where it breaks down.

Say we want to generate some random samples with different sample sizes:

``` r
sample_sizes <- c(10, 20, 15, 30)
samples <- sapply(
  sample_sizes,
  function(n) rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  simplify = FALSE
)

# Look at the lengths
sapply(samples, length)
```

    [1] 10 20 15 30

This works because we're only varying one thing: the sample size.
The mean and sd stay constant.

But what if we want different means for each sample?

``` r
sample_sizes <- c(10, 20, 15, 30)
means <- c(5, 10, 7, 12)

# This won't work as intended
samples <- sapply(sample_sizes, function(n) rnorm(n, mean = ???, sd = 1))
sapply(samples, mean)
```

We're stuck.
`sapply` can only iterate over one vector at a time.

## Enter mapply

`mapply` is designed exactly for this situation - when you need to pair up multiple vectors element-wise:

``` r
generate_samples <- function(n, mean_val) {
  rnorm(n, mean = mean_val, sd = 1)
}

sample_sizes <- c(10, 20, 15, 30)
means <- c(5, 10, 7, 12)

samples <- mapply(
  generate_samples,
  n = sample_sizes,
  mean_val = means,
  SIMPLIFY = FALSE
)

# Check the means of our samples
sapply(samples, mean)
```

    [1]  5.112995  9.896735  6.904238 12.074860

Perfect!
The first sample has `~10` observations with mean `~5`, the second has `~20` observations with mean `~10`, and so on.
An important thing with `mapply` is that the vectors you pass in must be the same length, as they are paired element-wise.
It will recycle shorter vectors, but that can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful.

``` r
# Only 2 means for 4 sizes
short_means <- c(5, 10)
samples <- mapply(
  generate_samples,
  n = sample_sizes,
  mean_val = short_means,
  SIMPLIFY = FALSE
)
sapply(samples, mean)
```

    [1]  4.880864  9.393517  5.050365 10.164239

You can see that the means are recycled, which may not be what you want.
So it's best to add a check to ensure your vectors are the same length before using `mapply`, if you are getting inputs from elsewhere.

``` r
if (length(sample_sizes) != length(means)) {
  stop("sample_sizes and means must be the same length")
}
```

## A more complex example: Scaling data

Let's work with something more realistic.
Say we have test scores from different classes, and we want to standardize each class separately, but with different target means and standard deviations.

``` r
# Create some test data
set.seed(42)
class_a <- rnorm(25, mean = 75, sd = 10)
class_b <- rnorm(30, mean = 82, sd = 8)
class_c <- rnorm(20, mean = 78, sd = 12)

scores <- list(class_a, class_b, class_c)
class_names <- c("Math", "Science", "English")
scores
```

``` r

```

``` r
sapply(scores, sd)
```

    [1] 13.063647  7.590105 12.118638

Now let's say we want to rescale each class to have specific target means and standard deviations:

``` r
# Math=80, Science=85, English=75
target_means <- c(80, 85, 75)

# Different spreads for each subject
target_sds <- c(5, 8, 10)
```

Here's the scaling function:

``` r
rescale_scores <- function(scores, target_mean, target_sd) {
  # Standardize to mean=0, sd=1
  standardized <- (scores - mean(scores)) / sd(scores)
  standardized * target_sd + target_mean
}
```

Using a loop would mean using a counter to index each vector, and would look like this:

``` r
rescaled_scores <- list()
for (i in seq_along(scores)) {
  rescaled_scores[[i]] <- rescale_scores(
    scores[[i]],
    target_means[i],
    target_sds[i]
  )
}
```

I'll be honest, this isn't too bad.
I've done it plenty of times, especially when the logic is more complex.
But once I got more comfortable creating my own functions, I found `mapply` to be a cleaner solution.
With `mapply`, we can do this cleanly without indexing:

``` r
rescaled_scores <- mapply(
  rescale_scores, # the function you want to apply
  scores = scores, # The varying inputs
  target_mean = target_means,
  target_sd = target_sds,
  SIMPLIFY = FALSE # to keep the output as a list
)

# Check our results
sapply(rescaled_scores, mean)
```

    [1] 80 85 75

``` r
sapply(rescaled_scores, sd)
```

    [1]  5  8 10

Exactly what we wanted!
No indexing, no temporary variables.
It really is a very clean solution.
Another nice thing about it is that since we are not relying in indexing, we can easily change the order of our inputs without breaking anything.

## Adding more arguments

What if we also want to add class identifiers?
We can add more vectors to match:

``` r
rescale_and_label <- function(scores, target_mean, target_sd, class_name) {
  rescaled <- rescale_scores(scores, target_mean, target_sd)
  data.frame(
    score = rescaled,
    class = class_name,
    student_id = seq_along(rescaled)
  )
}

result_data <- mapply(
  rescale_and_label,
  scores = scores,
  target_mean = target_means,
  target_sd = target_sds,
  class_name = class_names,
  SIMPLIFY = FALSE
)

# Combine into one data.frame
final_data <- do.call(rbind, result_data)
head(final_data)
```

         score class student_id
    1 84.52945  Math          1
    2 77.12089  Math          2
    3 80.67206  Math          3
    4 81.70445  Math          4
    5 80.82952  Math          5
    6 78.87604  Math          6

## When you have some constant arguments

Sometimes you have multiple varying inputs AND some constant ones.
That's where `MoreArgs` comes in, which lets you pass a list of constant arguments to your function.
This now becomes very powerful.

``` r
rescale_with_bounds <- function(
  scores,
  target_mean,
  target_sd,
  min_score,
  max_score
) {
  rescaled <- rescale_scores(scores, target_mean, target_sd)
  # Apply bounds
  pmax(min_score, pmin(max_score, rescaled))
}

# All classes have same score bounds
bounded_scores <- mapply(
  rescale_with_bounds,
  scores = scores,
  target_mean = target_means,
  target_sd = target_sds,
  MoreArgs = list(
    min_score = 0,
    max_score = 100
  ),
  SIMPLIFY = FALSE
)

# Check that we don't exceed bounds
sapply(bounded_scores, function(x) c(min = min(x), max = max(x)))
```

            [,1]     [,2]     [,3]
    min 69.11486 65.94341 44.50950
    max 88.03416 99.58667 88.00772

That's it!
You can mix and match varying and constant arguments easily.

## The mapply pattern

I find `mapply` most useful for:

1.  **Simulation studies** - varying multiple parameters simultaneously  
2.  **Data processing** - when different groups need different treatments  
3.  **Modeling** - fitting the same model type with different parameters

The pattern is always:

1.  Write a function that takes multiple arguments  
2.  Create vectors for each varying argument (same length)  
3.  Use `mapply` to pair them up  
4.  Add any constant arguments via `MoreArgs`

## Tidyverse equivalent

For completeness, the `purrr` equivalent uses `pmap`, which stands for "parallel map".
A map is a function that applies a function to each element of a list or vector, so acts like `lapply` or `sapply`.
The name "map" comes from other functional programming languages, and is therefore a name for this same concept that is more widely used outside of R.
In purrr, there are several types of map functions, which also validates the output type (e.g.Â `map_dbl` for numeric output, `map_chr` for character output, etc.).
The standard `map` function returns a list, like `lapply`.

As noted in the purrr documentation, "parallel" here does not refer to parallel computing, but rather that multiple inputs are processed together.
To use `pmap`, you need to put your varying inputs into a list, and in standard tidyverse fashion, the input is the first argument (contrary to the applies where it is further down the argument tree).

``` r
library(purrr)

result_data <- list(
  scores = scores,
  target_mean = target_means,
  target_sd = target_sds,
  class_name = class_names
) |>
  pmap(rescale_and_label)
result_data
```

Several things about `pmap` that I like a lot when I don't have to worry about dependencies:

1.  The input is the first argument, which I find more intuitive.  
2.  You can use the pipe operator to build up your inputs, which I find makes it easier to read.  
3.  You can use anonymous functions with the `~` syntax, which I find cleaner for short functions.  
4.  Additional constant arguments can be passed directly in the `pmap` call, without needing a separate `MoreArgs` list.  
5.  You can toggle progress bars with the `.progress` argument, which is nice for long-running tasks.  
6.  You can [easily add parallell processing](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/07/purrr-1-1-0-parallel/) using the {mirai} package.

Base R `mapply` keeps your dependencies minimal and works everywhere, if that is a concern.
But if you are already using the tidyverse, `pmap` is a great alternative, and in my opinion, is more readable.

## Wrapping up

Think of `mapply` as the tool for when you need to "zip" multiple vectors together and apply a function to each matched set.
If you find yourself writing loops where you're indexing into multiple vectors with the same `i`, that's usually a sign that `mapply` would be cleaner.
