So I've had several posts past year about using [httr2]{} in R to connect to various API's, like [Zenodo]().
In that journey, I have been trying to get things working with LinkedIn too, which is one of the three social-media type platforms I use to communicate. 
In that quest, there has been... much frustration.
I feel like I am becoming more and more comfortable with API's, both from R and from the shell. 
But LinkedIn had me thoroughly confused.
The documentation was hard to grasp and navigate.
The process was extremely obscure and I just could not _get it_.

Finally, after much aid from both [Jon Harmond][] and [Steffi LaZerte]() through my connection to rOpenSci, we were able to get it working!
I can't tell you how happy I was when I finally got that test post to LinkedIn through the API, the journey has been alsmot 5 months!
That being said, those five months means extremely sporadic trying giving my current health status, but still.

In this post I want to lay out the process I use as a _person_ to post to LinkedIn through their API.
I want to make sure this is very clear, as a _person_, not as a person on behalf of an organisation (which part of the confusion in this process stemmed from). 

## Getting LinkedIn API access

The first thing one needs to do, is to actually get access to the LinkedIn API.
The API is available through the [LinkedIn developers portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/).
Here, you should be able to log in with your LinkedIn credentials, or already be logged in if you are logged in to LinkedIn already.

> For Individual Developers: API products available to individual developers have a default Company page associated with them and you must select that default Company page to proceed.
