I've written posts before about adding images to ggplot, but in those cases I used the `annotate_custom` function, and loops. This procedure works pretty well, and its been a life saver for me in many places where I do this sort of plotting.

But there is a better way! I had vaguely seen something about a {ggimage} package around, but it was not until I saw it on Thomas Mock's [The Mockup Blog](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-10-11-embedding-images-in-ggplot/) that I saw how cool it was! 

And so, I thought we'd have a look at using that now, for adding neuroimaging pictures to heatplots!

In neuroimaging, heatplots are quite common. We use them often to show the correlation between networks, or even the correlations between network correlations.
