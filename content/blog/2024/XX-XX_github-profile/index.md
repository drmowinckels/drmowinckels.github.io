I've been meaning to improve my GitHub profile for a while, but I never got around to it.
I've seen some really cool ones, and I wanted to make one myself.
I finally got around to it, and I'm really happy with the result.

I've written a short tutorial on how I did it, and how you can too.

## What is a GitHub profile?

GitHub profiles are a way to showcase your work on GitHub.
It's a great way to show off your work, and to show your skills.
It's also a great way to learn new skills, and to learn how to use GitHub.


## How do I make a GitHub profile?
To create a GitHub profile, the landing page when you go to your GitHub account, you need to create a repository with the same name as your GitHub username.
For me, that's `drmowinckels`, so I created a repository called `drmowinckels`.
This repository needs to be public, and it needs to have a README.md file.
This README.md file is what will be displayed on your GitHub profile.

## How do I make a cool GitHub profile?
There are many ways to make a cool GitHub profile.
I've seen some really cool ones, and I've seen some really simple ones.
Until recently, mine was one of the simple ones.
I wanted to make a cool one, but I never got around to it.
I finally did, and I'm really happy with the result and would like to share what I've done!

## How I made my cool GitHub profile

My inspiration was coming across a blog post by [Kshyun28](https://dev.to/kshyun28/how-to-make-your-awesome-github-profile-hog) on how to make your GitHub profile awesome.
This popped up in my google chrome news feed, and it got me intrigued!

After that, I kind of went on down a rabbit hole of GitHub profile READMEs and found some really cool ones, based on all the links
Kshyun28 provide in their blogpost.
