I've been meaning to improve my GitHub profile for a while, but I never got around to it.
I've seen some really cool ones, and I wanted to make one myself.
I finally got around to it, and I'm really happy with the result.

I've written a short tutorial on how I did it, and how you can too.

## What is a GitHub profile?

GitHub profiles are a way to showcase your work on GitHub.
It's a great way to show off your work, and to show your skills.
It's also a great way to learn new skills, and to learn how to use GitHub.
