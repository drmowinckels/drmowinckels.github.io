summary: |
  People who code have a tendency to spend a lot of time in various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). These are the tools that help you write, test, and debug your code. They can be as simple as a text editor or as complex as a full-blown development environment. In this post, I'll go through my two go-to IDE's, RStudio and VScode, and why I switch between them rather than sticking to a single one.

## My previous experience with programming IDEs


### MATLAB

While R is my language of choice currently, it was not the first language I learned.
I started with MATLAB really, which has its own IDE.

I enjoyed my time working with MATLAB, and found the IDE satisfactory.
Though, this was the very beginning of my programming journey and I did not really have any other IDE to compare it to. 
It had a lot of functionality I never used.

But all the general components of what I now found to be a good IDE is there:
- A script editor
- A console
- A workspace
- A file browser
- A command history
- Windows to view graphics

### GNU editor (`gedit`)

Simultaneously, I was also using a simple text editor called `gedit` to write my bash shell code.
Being in neuroscience, MATLAB was not all I needed.
Yes, it was good for some stats and plots etc, but I also needed to run programs like `FSL` and `Freesurfer` which are most efficiently called from command line.

While I still do quite a bit of shell scripting, I no longer rely on the simple GNU editor.
`gedit` is nice because its simple and comes with every Linux distribution.
But its not an IDE in the sense I think of IDEs now.

It is a simple text editor, nothing else.
It does not have a console, a workspace, a file browser, a command history, or windows to view graphics. 
Its just for writing and saving text, that can be executed later.

It's harder to debug in `gedit` because you have to run your code in the terminal, and then go back to the editor to make changes. 
It does it's job, and I still revert to it for simple stuff, but generally, it's not something I do anymore.

## My current IDEs

### RStudio
When I began my R journey, RStudio was already available and I have been using it ever since.
