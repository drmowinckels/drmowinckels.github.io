2025 was a year of steady rebuilding: quieter than some years, but more deliberate and productive in the ways that matter. 
I continued to manage lingering post‑COVID effects that shaped how and when I work — I shipped less, but made each piece count.

## Highlights

## The health factor: still recovering
Post‑COVID recovery remains an important constraint. 
I still struggle with variable energy and slower recovery after exertion; that has influenced how I plan work, respond to requests, and set deadlines. 
The positive side is that this limitation forced better prioritization: I focus on durable outputs (tools, tutorials, packages) rather than quick, ephemeral experiments. 
I mention this here because it shaped my year — and because being transparent about it matters to me and, I hope, to readers in similar situations.

I've written about my experience with post‑COVID recovery in a few posts:
- [The difficult year](/blog/2025/the-difficult-year/)
- [Visible - Health tracking App](/blog/2025/visible/)
- [Visible — PCA exploration](/blog/2025/visible-pca/)

### API's and httr2
I've been exploring API work in R more deeply this year, particularly with the httr2 package.
APIs are a powerful way to access data and services, and httr2 provides a modern, flexible interface for working with them in R.
I wrote a couple of posts to share what I've learned:

- [LinkedIn API](/blog/2025/linkedin-api/)
- [httr2 client](/blog/2025/httr2_client/)
- [LinkedIn + Gemini](/blog/2025/linkedin_gemini/)

I did also manage to refactor and release [meetupr](https://rladies.org/meetupr/) to CRAN for R-Ladies, which was a satisfying side project. 
R-Ladies relies on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/) for event management, and this package makes it possible for the global team to monitor activity and generate reports directly from R. 

### R Package Development Advent Calendar
The R Package Development Advent Calendar was the year's biggest writing project: 25 focused entries that collectively became a practical reference for modern package authors. 
Building that series forced me to tidy my own habits around testing, CI, documentation, and CRAN submission — and it felt great to publish something immediately useful to the community.

## Looking ahead to 2026
Goals for 2026 are pragmatic: 
- continue balancing ambition with sustainable pace while I keep recovering.
- refine and share my workflows for reproducible work in R.
- slowly increase my capacity to work, engage, and create.


Happy New Year, and thanks for reading!
