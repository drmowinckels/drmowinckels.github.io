      <description>When you have lots of old blog posts, writing good summaries for SEO can be very tedious. Using AI, we can get summaries for our posts easily. Using httr2 we can access models through the Hugging Face API.</description>

      <description>In August, Heidi Seibold wrote in her Newsletter about how she made it FAIR.
This made me think about my own writing and how to secure the content even when/if I port by blog or change its structure.
Here, I show how I use R, GitHub Actions and Zenodo API to create dois for all my posts.</description>

      <description>In May I wrote about my favorite IDE&amp;rsquo;s.
As a result of that post, I was asked to join Posits private beta-testers for their new IDE, Positron.
Now Positron is out of private beta, so let&amp;rsquo;s see if it can replace my current favorite IDE&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>GitHub is a major developer platform, and your profile is the first thing people see when they visit your account.
Your GitHub profile should then showcase who you are, what you know and what you&amp;rsquo;re learning.
This is how I vamped up my GitHub profile, to showcase who I am, what I know and what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.</description>

      <description>We all know the R startup message. It tells us the version
of R we are running, the date, the platform we are running
on, and some informative tips on using R.
When you&amp;rsquo;ve been using R a while, though, it gets old.
Let me show you how you can customise your startup message!</description>

      <description>People who code have a tendency to spend a lot of time in various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). They can be as simple as a text editor or as complex as a full-blown development environment. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through my two go-to IDE&amp;rsquo;s, RStudio and VScode, and why I switch between them rather than sticking to a single one.</description>

      <description>Version control is great, but sometimes it can trip you up!
In this post I recount my rather stupid mistake of using &lt;code&gt;git clean&lt;/code&gt; when I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, and how I got out of it.</description>

      <description>There is a general air of excitement, nerdiness and support I just rarely feel at any other conf I go to. Posit::conf is like it gathers all the best Data science and R geeks in one place and we just go bananas in each others company. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some thoughts and joys I had in the 4 days of the conf .</description>

      <description>When programming we want to write code that iterates well, we do this through loops . Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Apply&amp;rsquo;ing is based on the very well-known &lt;code&gt;mtcars&lt;/code&gt; dataset built-in to R . We&amp;rsquo;ll only use two columns, just to keep it simple .</description>

      <description>Rmarkdown has been working on a set of analyses from a survey at work . The survey has two basic type of questions, likert-scale questions and binary yes/no questions . For each of these two types of . questions, Iâ€™ve needed to generate a . set of descriptive plots and tables, as well as run a particular set of statistical models . I know how to make Rmark down parametrised reports, and I kind of wanted something similar, but in a nested fashion .</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to Build your Hugo Website</title>
      <link>https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021/using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/</link>

      <guid>https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021/using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/</guid>
      <description>Using GitHub Actions is a service that runs Continuous Integration, meaning that using a set-up file you can ask workers (computers run by GitHub) to do certain operations on your repository at certain triggers (at push, pull-requests or even on a schedule with crontab) This is where GitHub Actions shines. It is free and so are its actions for small jobs like what we want to do . To build on Netlify, you need all your content version controlled, in my case with git, and stored on GitHub . This is fine and dandy for text files like markdown, csv data, and images that &lt;em&gt;will not change often&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

I find these holiday cards help me understand and explore how data need to look to create a certain output . I wanted to use &lt;code&gt;ggforce::geom_circle&lt;/code&gt; for this, which would need x and y coordinates for the center of the circle and the radius .</description>

      <description>Blogdown is usually used with [go hugo], a static webpage builder . Blogdown renders directly from &lt;code&gt;Rmd&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;html, meaning it circumvents hugo&#39;s processing of &lt;/code&gt;md` . This can cause some unwanted issues depending on your theme . It can also make it difficult to maintain your webpage over time .</description>

      <description>R requires you to be proficient in R in a different way than SPSS . Once you are proficient enough in R, you have a gazillion tools to do more or less anything you want to do, be it analysing complex data, a simple linear regression, writing a blog or making interactive data portals . RStudio is a completely blank slate, no data, no fancy stuff, just a program .</description>

      <description>The ggseg package was so well received that we almost immediately got it on [Neuroconductor]. We got some pull requests from people helping us improve the code, and particularly get it ready for CRAN when we decide to submit it there . The package vignettes are update on how you may supply data for facetting .</description>

      <description>The ggseg R-package for brain segmentations is intended for those who need to easily plot results or overviews of segmentet data . The package is developed as part of our lab [The Center for Lifespanism and Cognition [LCBC-UiO]</description>

      <title>Circular plots in R and adding images</title>

      <description>Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena . I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it .</description>

      <description>Adding external images to plots is a good way to showcase results, and make it easier for me and my reader to understand what the findings are . I use [ImageMagick] for this, but there are R-packages to help, like [imager] and [imaging] software .</description>

      <title>GAMM random effects</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working a lot with Generalized Additive Mixed Mixed Models (GAMMs) I started seeing some differences in the output from other mixed models I had run through [lme4] and even Bayesian mixed models with [rstanarm] The random effects terms were specified differently . At first I thought this was mainly the fact that I was now using smoothing splines, which I was unfamiliar with running before .</description>

      <description>A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package [mgcv] The analyses work very well, and results were as expected . There were also some built in plotting functions for the gamm output in R . However, they were with base-r, and we all know base r is not the most beautiful .</description>
